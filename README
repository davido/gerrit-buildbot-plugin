Buildbot Gerrit Plugin
======================

Buildbot Gerrit Plugin (BGP) is a queue manager for gerrit patch verification.
It coordinates the decental located tinderboxes without having a continued
network connection to them by maintaining platform specific blocking queue of
n platform tasks for each gerrit patch. The patch set considered as verified
(+1) then and only then when all tinderbox tasks are reported success back.
In this case gerrit verify status is reported back to gerrit.
In addition log publication is provided by log servlet.

Workflow description
============================================
0. During BGP activation the configuration file buildbot.config is read and
   gerrit-stream event listener is installed.
1. User submit a gerrit patch, PatchSetCreatedEvent is triggered by gerrit and
   consumed by BGP. In the new BGP version this event is discarded
   (alternatively different BGP build trigger strategies can be configured per project base)
2. The patch get aproved with gerrit `review` ssh command (or through web UI).
3. BGP consumes gerrit's CommentAddedEvent, checks if for the project, that event
   is triggered for, BGP is activated and check Norbert's rule:
   a proposed patch get build if and only if: it is not merged, it has no review < 0, it
   has no verify < 0 and has at least 1 review > 0 from a user that belong
   to the `Reviewer` Group. If those conditions are met, the follow actions is taken:
a) creates a Gerrit Job instance
b) populates platform task map with verify task per platform.
   Platforms are currently hard coded: WINDOWS, LINUX and MAC.
3. tinderbox that configured gerrit verification
   (see tinbuild2 script in LO repo) periodically call BGP `get-task` ssh command
   and get gerrit patch for veification. Note that because of blocking queue
   only one tinderbox per platform and per gerrit job get engaged.
   When a tinderbox get assign a test build, repport that in a review message. 
4. tinderbox build the recieved gerrit task and report the outcome and the
   the log file with BGP `report` ssh command. When a tinderbox outcome is known 
   repport that in a review message (success, failure, time-out)
   Note: these review message do not impact Verity status... they just
   provide progress information.
5. Once all tasks for a job are ready, the combined verify result is reported back
   to gerrit through BGP.
6. Problems/Timeouts/Recovering:
a) If a task not get pulled by any tinderbox after some time out time, we call
   it idle timeout, then the job is reported to gerrit with unknown (neutral)
   state (even if some tinderbox tasks reported a result)
b) If a task was pulled by some tinderbox, but no result is reported in some
   reasonable amount of time (say 4 hours), then the task should be
   rescheduled once time again. If after rescheduling the original task reports
   status it should be discarded.
c) persist the job and task list in the data base. 
d) the plug-in need to be restartable. That is when the
   plug in is brought back up after being down, it should resume where it
   left off... for example, a tinderbox should be able to ask for a task
   before a gerrit shutdown and then report the result after gerrit
   restart. This will make maintenance-driven restart less intrusive/costly.

TODOs:
1. Pipe line visualisation: with gerrit jobs and tasks per platform are get
  currently building and pending.
2. management cockpit/dashboard with previously build taskes with statistics.
3. Enhance gerrit's core patch view with table containing tinderbox
  verification status on per platform base.
4. Consider patch specific requirements in tinderbox configuration per patch
  base (i. e. with-java) and propagate these requirement to the tinderboxes.
  To implement this, tinderbox must be identified by his current configuration
  set in addition to its platform.
5. add priority to scheduler, that can be influenced through web UI or ssh command.
6. If a patch is 'submitted' while the verification tinbuild are pending then
a) we let already running tindebox finish, and still report the result
in t 'review' comment as usual, but leave the verify flags untouched
(I don't think you can modify it after merge anyway)
b) any platform that is not started yet is 'discarded' for that patch.
iow the task taht are not started yet are de-queued by 'Submit'.
